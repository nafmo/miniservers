These are two minimal HTTP servers used for testing purposes:

 echoserver

echos back whatever was sent to it (in HTML form). Useful for testing forms.

 authserver

requires you to send authorization data to it, and echos it back when it
gets it. Useful for testing authorization.


Enable the servers in your /etc/inetd.conf:

81	stream	tcp	nowait	nobody	/usr/sbin/tcpd /path/to/echoserver
82	stream	tcp	nowait	nobody	/usr/sbin/tcpd /path/to/authserver
